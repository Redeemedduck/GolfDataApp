## 3. SESSION NAME PATTERNS & CLASSIFICATION

Analysis of all 125 session names reveals distinct naming conventions and patterns that evolved over time.

### Category 1: Single Club Practice Sessions

Sessions focused on practicing a single club. These are straightforward and map directly to club types.

| Pattern | Examples | Club Mapping |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| Full club name | "Iron 1", "Iron 6", "Iron 8", "Iron 9", "Driver", "Wood 3", "Wedge Pitching", "Wedge 56" | Direct (1:1) |
| Numbered shorthand | "9", "7", "8", "6" | Map to "9 Iron", "7 Iron", etc. |
| Lowercase variant | "driver", "9 iron", "8 iron" | Direct with case normalization |
| Prefixed/hyphenated | "m 7 iron", "3 driving iron" | Extract club number: "7 Iron", "3 Iron" |
| System format | "DRIVER \| MEDIUM", "IRON7 \| MEDIUM", "IRON6 \| MEDIUM", "HYBRID1 \| MEDIUM", "WEDGE PITCHING \| MEDIUM" | Parse club name before pipe |

**Count in database:** ~40-50 sessions fit this pattern

---

### Category 2: Course/Simulation Golf Rounds

Sessions that represent playing a full or partial course, often in simulators or real rounds. These typically contain mixed clubs and should not be collapsed to a single club name.

| Pattern | Examples | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Named courses | "broadmore east front", "broadmoar", "candlestone", "estes park", "streamsong front" | Real golf courses |
| Sim golf tours | "sgt rd1", "sgt rd2", "sgt wailaie rd1 cont", "sgt shadowridge rd2", "sgt plantation course", "silvertip rd2", "silvertip sgt tour rd 1", "torrey north sim tour rd 2" | SGT = Sim Golf Tour |
| Par 3 courses | "par 3", "par3" | Short course |
| Facility-specific | "dpt scottsdale sgt1", "dpc scottsdale" | Likely location-based rounds |

**Count in database:** ~25-30 sessions fit this pattern

**Key insight:** Course/round sessions should NOT be normalized to individual club names. Instead, they should be flagged as "Round/Course" type sessions and analyzed as a complete session with mixed club composition.

---

### Category 3: Warmup, Drill & Practice Sessions

Sessions focused on specific drills, warmup routines, or practice techniques. These may be single-club focused or mixed.

| Pattern | Examples | Type |
|---------|----------|------|
| Warmup | "warmup", "warmup 8 dst" | Generic warmup |
| Distance simulator trainer | "dst trainer", "3/4 speed towel drill" | Equipment/drill-based |
| Bag/club mapping | "bag mapping" | Inventory/setup |
| Challenges | "60 shot challenge" | Competitive/challenge format |
| Tempo/mechanics | "9 iron tempo and path", "7 iron (tempo)", "7 iron shoulders right" | Technique-focused |

**Count in database:** ~10-15 sessions fit this pattern

---

### Category 4: Mixed/Miscellaneous Sessions

Sessions with generic, unclear, or multi-club names that don't fit above categories.

| Pattern | Examples | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Generic | "mixed shots", "multi", "random" | Unknown composition |
| Abbreviations | "wm", "prov", "two" | Non-descriptive |
| System test | "test" | Likely test/demo data |
| Unclassified | (any other single-word names) | Insufficient context |

**Count in database:** ~5-10 sessions fit this pattern

---

## 4. USER PROFILES & OWNERSHIP

The database contains sessions recorded by at least 10 distinct user profiles. Understanding which users represent the actual owner vs. facility guests/other users is critical for filtering personal analytics.

### Primary Owner
| User Name | Sessions (approx.) | Date Range | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **matt** | 70+ | Dec 2023 - Feb 2026 | Primary owner, most recent activity |

The user "matt" appears throughout the entire dataset, with peak activity Dec 2025 - Feb 2026 (very recent).

### Secondary Owner / Possible Same Person
| User Name | Sessions (approx.) | Date Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **@Rino3563** | 15-20 | Jan - Mar 2025 | Peak in early 2025, appears to have similar name pattern |
| **RH Rino** | 1 | Jan 17, 2025 | Single session, likely variant of @Rino3563 |

@Rino3563 and RH Rino appear to be the same person or closely related (possibly same account with display name change).

### Facility/Generic Profiles
| User Name | Sessions (approx.) | Date Range | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Guest** | 15+ | Jan - Aug 2024 | Anonymous | Multiple sessions by different people |
| **Guest 1** | 2-3 | Jan 2024 | Anonymous | Variant of Guest |
| **S&F Guest** | 3-4 | Jun - Mar 2024 | Facility guest | Likely "Swing & Fitness" or similar |
| **Right Handed** | 2-3 | Feb - Apr 2025 | Generic profile | Hand/gender descriptor |
| **Left Handed** | 2 | Jan 2025 | Generic profile | Left-handed golfer |
| **Optimum Golf** | 1 | Mar 21, 2025 | Facility profile | Generic facility name |
| **optimum golf 4** | 1 | Feb 04, 2025 | Facility profile | Likely same facility, variant |
| **Optimum LH** | (likely on later pages) | (likely 2025) | Facility profile | Left-handed variant |
| **Optimum Thornton** | (likely on later pages) | (likely 2025) | Facility profile | Location-specific variant |

### Guest/Multiple User Sessions
| User Name | Sessions (approx.) | Date Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ry Hawley** | 4-5 | Jun - Sep 2024 | Another user (likely friend/guest) |
| **Ry** | 1 | Jul 31, 2024 | Variant/abbreviation of Ry Hawley |
| **hunter lumpkin** | 1 | Mar 18, 2025 | One-time user |

### Recommendation for Personal Analytics
For personal swing data analysis, filter to:
- User = "matt" (primary owner, all recent data)
- Optionally include @Rino3563 / RH Rino if confirmed as same person
- Exclude all Guest*, Right Handed, Left Handed, Optimum*, Ry variants, and hunter lumpkin

This reduces 125 sessions to approximately 70-90 sessions representing the owner's actual swing data.

---

## 5. INDIVIDUAL REPORT PAGE STRUCTURE

When clicking "Open Report" on a session (e.g., "Iron 1" from Feb 09, 2026), the portal opens a detailed report page.

### Report URL Pattern
```
https://my.uneekor.com/power-u-report?id={sessionId}&key={shareKey}&distance={unit}&speed={unit}
```

**Example:**
```
https://my.uneekor.com/power-u-report?id=44266&key=VNtLJm0Z63pVsWNu&distance=yard&speed=mph
```

### Report Header
Displays session metadata:
- **Session Title:** "Power U Report"
- **Date:** In format YYYY.MM.DD (e.g., "2026.02.09")
- **User Info:** Name (e.g., "matt"), Hand (Right/Left), Gender (Male/Female)
- **Unit Settings:** Distance (yard/meter), Speed (mph/kph)

### Left Sidebar: Sub-session List

A single report can contain multiple sub-sessions (e.g., different clubs hit during the same practice session). The sidebar shows all sub-sessions with shot counts.

**Example for session 44266 (Iron 1, Feb 09, 2026):**
```
(46) Iron 1              ← Main session, 46 shots
(0)  8 iron             ← Sub-session, 0 shots (empty)
(25) warmup 8 dst       ← Sub-session, 25 shots
─────────────────
Total: 71 shots
```

**Key insight:** The left sidebar sub-session names map directly to what appears in the golf_db.py "club" column. A session may have club names like:
- "Iron 1" (main)
- "8 iron" (sub-session name, even though no shots recorded)
- "warmup 8 dst" (sub-session name, not actually "8 dst" the club)

This explains club name fragmentation: sub-sessions are treated as separate "clubs" in the data export.

---

### Report Tabs

The report provides multiple views of the data:

| Tab | Purpose | Content |
|---|---|---|
| **Summary** | Overview statistics | Average and max values across all metrics |
| **Side** | Side-view trajectory | Shot visualization (side profile) + per-shot table |
| **Top** | Top-down trajectory | (Inferred: top-down view of ball flight) |
| **Group** | Grouped analysis | (Likely groups shots by similar outcomes) |
| **Club** | Club data | Dynamic Loft, Face Angle, Path, Angle metrics |
| **Optix** | Launch monitor metrics | (Optix is the launch monitor brand) |
| **Swing** | Swing mechanics | (Toggleable view; may show swing video or sensor data) |

---

### Data Anomalies & Outliers

During review of the report page data, several anomalies were noted:

**Example 1: Shot #46 in Iron 1 session**
```
Shot #46:
  Carry:      19.0 yards
  Total:      29.4 yards
  Launch:     48.0°
  Ball Speed: 30.5 mph
  Smash:      0.41
  Status:     Highlighted in red/pink
```
**Interpretation:** Classic duff shot (mishit). Very short carry, very low smash factor, likely caught on club heel or blade.

**Example 2: Shot #44 (inferred context)**
```
  Carry:      306.9 yards
  Total:      329.2 yards
  Status:     Highlighted in red/pink
```
**Interpretation:** Extreme distance for an iron shot, or data entry error. Possible causes:
- Different club was used (driver instead of 7 iron)
- Data corruption from launch monitor
- Sensor misread

**Highlighting Rule:** The portal automatically highlights shots with anomalous values in red or pink, making them easy to spot for manual review.

## 6. KEY OBSERVATIONS & PATTERNS

### Evolution Over Time

The database shows clear evolution in naming conventions and user behavior:

**Early Period (Jan 2024 - Sep 2024): Facility/Guest Dominance**
- All sessions use system-generated format: "CLUB | DIFFICULTY" (e.g., "DRIVER | MEDIUM")
- Users: Guest, S&F Guest, Ry Hawley
- Likely public facility or demo data
- ~40-50 sessions

**Transition Period (Oct 2024 - Feb 2025): User Takeover**
- Mix of system-generated and user-named sessions
- New primary user @Rino3563 appears
- Generic profiles (Right Handed, Left Handed, optimum golf variants)
- More descriptive names: "9 iron tempo and path", "7 iron (tempo)", "mixed shots"
- ~30-40 sessions

**Recent Period (Mar 2025 - Feb 2026): Owner Consolidation**
- User "matt" becomes dominant
- All user-named (no system format)
- Diverse session types: clubs, courses, drills, round simulations
- High activity: 50+ sessions in ~12 months
- ~50-70 sessions

### Shot Count Distribution

| Sessions | Avg Shots | Typical Range | Likely Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single-digit (1-15) | 6 | Test/setup sessions | Test data, empty sub-sessions |
| Low (16-50) | 30 | Focused drills | Warmup, specific drill work |
| Medium (51-80) | 65 | Full practice | Practice round, club-focused |
| High (81-130) | 95 | Extended session/course | Full course round, bag mapping |

The median session contains 45-50 shots, suggesting typical sessions are focused 30-60 minute practice blocks.

### User Handedness & Specificity

Sessions explicitly labeled with handedness ("Right Handed", "Left Handed") suggest either:
1. Multi-user facility with profile switching
2. Swing analysis with different stances/approaches
3. Demo data for sales/training

All recent matt sessions show "Right Handed" in the user profile header, indicating primary right-handed golfer.

## 7. DATA QUALITY OBSERVATIONS

### Known Issues

1. **Sub-session Fragmentation**
   - Problem: A single practice session may be split into multiple "sub-sessions" in the sidebar, each with its own name
   - Impact: "club" field in exported data may contain sub-session names like "warmup 8 dst" instead of actual club "8 Iron"
   - Root Cause: Uneekor's portal groups shots by time windows or user interaction rather than by club selection

2. **Date Reliability**
   - Problem: Report pages may show today's date instead of the original session date in some cases
   - Impact: Session date accuracy should be verified against listing page
   - Mitigation: Listing page date (e.g., "Feb 09, 2026") is more reliable than report page date

3. **Sentinel Values**
   - Value 99999+ in any field = Uneekor's "no data" sentinel
   - Must be filtered/cleaned during import
   - Commonly appears in fields with missing sensor data

4. **Club Name Fragmentation**
   - 70+ distinct club values in database
   - Maps to roughly 9 actual clubs + various course names + sub-session names
   - Normalization essential for analytics

5. **Anomalous Shots**
   - Some shots are visibly erroneous (duffs, sensor misreads)
   - Portal highlights them but doesn't filter them
   - Manual review recommended for outliers > 3 sigma from session mean

## 8. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DATA INTEGRATION

### Club Name Normalization Strategy

Create a mapping table in automation/naming_conventions.py or similar:

```python
CLUB_MAPPING = {
    # Direct mappings
    "Driver": "Driver",
    "Iron 1": "1 Iron",
    "Iron 6": "6 Iron",
    "Iron 7": "7 Iron",
    "Iron 8": "8 Iron",
    "Iron 9": "9 Iron",
    "Wood 3": "3 Wood",
    "Wedge Pitching": "Pitching Wedge",
    "Wedge 56": "56° Wedge",
    
    # Numbered shorthand
    "6": "6 Iron",
    "7": "7 Iron",
    "8": "8 Iron",
    "9": "9 Iron",
    
    # Prefixed variants
    "m 7 iron": "7 Iron",
    "3 driving iron": "3 Iron",
    
    # System format (parse before pipe)
    "DRIVER | MEDIUM": "Driver",
    "DRIVER | PREMIUM": "Driver",
    "IRON6 | MEDIUM": "6 Iron",
    "IRON7 | MEDIUM": "7 Iron",
    "IRON8 | MEDIUM": "8 Iron",
    "IRON9 | MEDIUM": "9 Iron",
    "HYBRID1 | MEDIUM": "3 Hybrid",
    "WEDGE PITCHING | MEDIUM": "Pitching Wedge",
    
    # Flag for special handling (don't normalize to clubs)
    "warmup": "__WARMUP__",
    "warmup 8 dst": "__WARMUP__",
    "dst trainer": "__DRILL__",
    "3/4 speed towel drill": "__DRILL__",
    "bag mapping": "__SETUP__",
    "60 shot challenge": "__CHALLENGE__",
    "mixed shots": "__MIXED__",
}

# Course/round sessions (flag as session_type="ROUND" instead of normalizing club)
COURSE_PATTERNS = [
    "broadmore", "candlestone", "estes park", "streamsong",
    "torrey", "silvertip", "sgt", "dpt ", "dpc ", "par 3", "par3"
]
```

**Algorithm:**
1. Look up exact session name in CLUB_MAPPING
2. If found and value starts with "__", flag as special session type
3. If not found and matches COURSE_PATTERNS regex, flag as session_type="ROUND"
4. If still not found, try case-insensitive prefix matching
5. If no match, leave as-is and log for manual review

### Outlier Detection Strategy

Implement detection based on club-specific thresholds:

```python
CLUB_THRESHOLDS = {
    "Driver": {
        "min_ball_speed": 100,
        "max_ball_speed": 180,
        "min_smash": 1.30,
        "max_smash": 1.50,
    },
    "7 Iron": {
        "min_ball_speed": 90,
        "max_ball_speed": 160,
        "min_smash": 1.20,
        "max_smash": 1.40,
    },
    # ... etc for all clubs
}

def flag_outliers(shot_row, club):
    """Flag shots that deviate significantly from club norms."""
    if club not in CLUB_THRESHOLDS:
        return None
    
    thresholds = CLUB_THRESHOLDS[club]
    issues = []
    
    if shot_row["ball_speed"] < thresholds["min_ball_speed"]:
        issues.append("BALL_SPEED_LOW")
    if shot_row["ball_speed"] > thresholds["max_ball_speed"]:
        issues.append("BALL_SPEED_HIGH")
    if shot_row["smash_factor"] < thresholds["min_smash"]:
        issues.append("SMASH_LOW")  # Mishit
    if shot_row["smash_factor"] > thresholds["max_smash"]:
        issues.append("SMASH_HIGH")  # Equipment issue or measurement error
    
    return issues if issues else None
```

### Warmup Shot Detection

For sessions without explicit "warmup" sub-session:

```python
def detect_warmup_shots(session_shots, club):
    """
    Detect warmup shots based on carry distance progression.
    Warmup shots show improvement trend: low → high → stable
    """
    if len(session_shots) < 3:
        return []  # Too few shots to analyze
    
    carries = session_shots["carry"].values
    
    # Calculate moving averages
    moving_avg_3 = pd.Series(carries).rolling(3).mean()
    
    # Warmup detected if early shots are outliers (low/variable)
    # and later shots form stable plateau
    warmup_threshold = moving_avg_3.iloc[5:].mean() * 0.85  # 15% below stable avg
    
    warmup_shots = []
    for i, carry in enumerate(carries):
        if i < 5 and carry < warmup_threshold:
            warmup_shots.append(i)
        elif i >= 5:
            break  # Exit after first 5 shots or stable region reached
    
    return warmup_shots
```

### Session Type Classification

Auto-classify sessions based on naming patterns:

```python
def classify_session_type(session_name, club_list):
    """Classify session as PRACTICE, ROUND, WARMUP, DRILL, or CHALLENGE."""
    name_lower = session_name.lower()
    
    if any(p in name_lower for p in ["warmup", "dst trainer", "towel drill"]):
        return "WARMUP"
    if any(p in name_lower for p in ["challenge", "60 shot"]):
        return "CHALLENGE"
    if any(p in name_lower for p in ["mapping", "setup"]):
        return "SETUP"
    if any(p in name_lower for p in ["par 3", "sgt", "broadmore", "candlestone", "torrey", "streamsong", "estes", "silvertip"]):
        return "ROUND"
    if any(p in name_lower for p in ["mixed", "multi", "random"]):
        return "MIXED"
    if len(club_list) == 1 and club_list[0] not in ["__WARMUP__", "__DRILL__", "__SETUP__"]:
        return "PRACTICE"
    
    return "UNCLASSIFIED"
```

### User Filtering for Personal Analytics

```python
OWNER_USERNAMES = ["matt"]  # or ["matt", "@Rino3563"] if same person
EXCLUDE_USERS = ["Guest", "Guest 1", "S&F Guest", "Right Handed", "Left Handed", 
                 "Optimum", "Ry Hawley", "Ry", "hunter lumpkin"]

def filter_personal_sessions(all_sessions):
    """Return only sessions belonging to the owner."""
    return [s for s in all_sessions if s["user"] in OWNER_USERNAMES]
```
