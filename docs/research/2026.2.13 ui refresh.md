The Core Insight
A golfer's brain works in three modes: "How am I doing overall?", "How's my [specific club]?", and "What happened in [that session]?" Your app needs to serve all three instantly, not force the user to navigate a data hierarchy to find answers.
Uneekor already does a great job as a per-session report viewer. There's no point rebuilding that. Your app's value is what Uneekor can't do: aggregate across sessions, track trends over time, and give the golfer a higher-level understanding of their game.
Navigation — Four Pages, That's It
Home — the training log and overview.
My Bag — per-club deep dives and the bag distance map.
Session — single-session analysis (the Uneekor-like detailed view).
Settings — import, data management, preferences.
No AI Coach page cluttering nav when it's not configured. No duplicate nav sections. No developer controls visible. Four items in the sidebar, always.
Page 1: Home (Training Log)
This is what a golfer sees when they open the app. Not a single session's stats. Not a chart. A training log — the last 2-4 weeks of their golf life.
Top strip — three big numbers, always visible: total sessions this month, total shots this month, and the one metric the golfer cares about most (configurable — maybe avg carry with their most-used club, or avg smash factor trending up/down). These should feel like the top of a fitness tracker dashboard.
Session list — the main body of the page. Each session is a card, not a table row. A card shows the date, the session name (from Uneekor), a colored tag for type (Practice, Round, Warmup, Drill — auto-detected or manually set), the clubs used as small pill badges, total shots, and one key stat like avg carry or best carry. Clicking a card takes you to the Session page for that session.
The session cards should look visually distinct by type. A Round card might have a subtle course-green accent. A Practice card might be blue. A Warmup card could be muted/gray. This way the golfer can scan their log and immediately see the shape of their training week — "oh, I did three practice sessions but no rounds this week."
Date filtering — a simple "This Week / This Month / Last 30 / All Time" toggle at the top. Not a date picker. Golfers don't think in exact date ranges, they think in recency.
Trends strip — below the session list or in a sidebar, a small sparkline-style section showing 3-4 key metrics over the filtered time period. Carry distance trending up? Smash factor improving? Face angle getting more consistent? These should be tiny visual lines with a green up-arrow or red down-arrow, not full charts. The golfer should be able to glance at this and feel good (or motivated) in two seconds.
Page 2: My Bag
This is the page your current Club Profiles is trying to be, but designed around how golfers actually think about their equipment.
The bag layout — the top of the page shows a visual representation of the golfer's bag. Not a dropdown. A horizontal row of club cards ordered from Driver through wedges, like looking down into a golf bag. Each card shows the club name, average carry distance, and a tiny consistency indicator (tight = good, wide = inconsistent). Think of it as 14 cards in a row that the golfer scrolls horizontally through on mobile, or sees all at once on desktop.
The gap chart — directly below the bag, a simple vertical bar chart or stepped line showing the distance gap between each club. This is the single most important visualization for a golfer setting up their bag. "My 7 iron goes 165, my 8 iron goes 152, that's a 13-yard gap — good. But my PW goes 135 and my 50° goes 112 — that's a 23-yard gap, I need to address that." Every golfer thinks about this constantly. Your current app has no way to see this.
Club detail — clicking any club card opens a detail panel (slide-in from the right, not a new page) showing that club's stats over time: avg carry trend line, smash factor trend, Big 3 summary (face angle, path, strike), consistency metrics (standard deviation of carry, of side distance). This is where your existing Big 3 cards and histograms live, but scoped to one real club, not "estes park."
Club comparison — at the bottom of the detail panel, a "Compare" button that lets you overlay another club's stats. Default to the clubs on either side in the bag (looking at 7 iron? suggest 6 iron and 8 iron). The radar chart from your current app works well here.
The bag setup — a one-time configuration (accessible from Settings but prompted on first use) where the golfer defines their 14 clubs with canonical names. This creates the normalization map: "When Uneekor says IRON7, Iron 7, 7, or M 7 Iron, that's my 7 Iron." This is the foundation that makes everything else work.
Page 3: Session (Single Session Deep Dive)
This replaces your current Dashboard. It's opened by clicking a session card from Home, not by navigating to it directly (though you can bookmark/link to a specific session).
Session header — session name, date, type tag, total shots, and a notes field. The notes field is the single most underrated feature you're missing. After a practice session, the golfer types "Working on keeping face square through impact, felt like half-swings were clicking" and now when they look back at this session in a month, the data has context.
Layout depends on session type:
For a Practice session (single club): Lead with the Big 3 analysis (face angle, club path, strike location). This is what the golfer was working on. Show the distribution histograms, the D-Plane scatter, and then a shot-by-shot progression chart showing whether they got better or worse over the session. The dispersion plot goes below that. The raw shot table is at the very bottom, collapsed by default.
For a Round session (multi-club): Lead with a club breakdown — a compact table or card grid showing each club used, shot count, and avg carry (similar to Uneekor's Summary tab). Below that, the full-bag dispersion plot showing all shots color-coded by club. Then let the golfer click into any individual club from the round to see that subset's detail. Think of it as a mini-version of the My Bag page, but scoped to just this round.
For a Warmup session: Keep it minimal. Just show the progression — "your first 5 shots averaged 120 carry, your last 5 averaged 155 carry, you were warm by shot 8." Warmup data shouldn't pollute the golfer's real practice stats, but seeing the warmup curve is useful for knowing how long they need to warm up.
Shot-by-shot progression — this is a feature neither your app nor Uneekor does well. A simple line chart with shot number on the x-axis and carry distance (or face angle, or whatever metric) on the y-axis. This answers "did I get better during this session?" and "when did I start fatiguing?" It's trivially easy to build and incredibly valuable.
Page 4: Settings
Clean, minimal. Three sections:
Import — paste Uneekor URL, run import. Show import history. This is basically what you have now but without the technical clutter.
My Bag — the club normalization setup. Define your 14 clubs, set aliases. Set target distances per club if you want goal tracking.
Data — maintenance tools (duplicate detection, data validation), tag management, database sync. All the developer-facing stuff lives here and only here.
Design Principles
No metric without context. A smash factor of 1.22 means nothing unless the golfer knows whether that's good for their club. Show smash factor with the target for that specific club next to it. Show carry distance with their personal average and personal best. Every number should answer "is this good?" at a glance.
Color means something. Green = good/improving. Red/orange = needs attention. Blue = neutral/informational. Don't use color decoratively. When the golfer sees orange on their face angle card, they know immediately that's the area to work on.
Session types drive the experience. A round and a practice session are fundamentally different activities and should look different in the app. Don't force the same view for both. Auto-detect the type on import (multi-club sessions with course-like names = Round; single-club sessions = Practice; short sessions with "warmup" in the name = Warmup) and let the user correct it.
Aggregate is the value-add. Uneekor already shows you one session beautifully. Your app exists to answer "how am I trending across my last 10 practice sessions with my 7 iron?" That's the question Uneekor can't answer, and it's the question that actually drives improvement.
Mobile-first hierarchy. Even if you're building for desktop, design each page so the most important information is in the top 400 pixels. A golfer at the sim between sessions will glance at this on their phone. If they have to scroll past a dispersion plot to find their average carry, the design failed.
Kill the sidebar bloat. No data source indicators, no read mode dropdowns, no "Supabase shots: 2159" visible during normal use. The sidebar has four nav links, your name/avatar, and nothing else. Everything else is Settings.
What I'd Specifically Throw Away From the Current App
The session ID as a concept visible to users (replace with session name + date). The "Filter by Club" multi-select in the sidebar (replace with the bag layout). The Multi-Metric Club Comparison radar chart on the Dashboard (move to My Bag's compare feature). The Overview/Big 3 Deep Dive/Shots tab structure on the Dashboard (restructure around session type). The "Compact Layout" toggle (just make one good layout). The duplicate Navigation section. All technical indicators in the main UI.
What I'd Keep
The Big 3 Impact Laws cards and histograms — great concept, just needs better visual polish and to be scoped to real clubs. The D-Plane scatter plot — genuinely useful, keep it. The dispersion plot — solid, keep it. The tagging system — good foundation, just needs to be more automatic. The export to CSV. The dark mode toggle (but put it in Settings, not the sidebar).
The One Feature I'd Add That Changes Everything
Session notes + goals. Let the golfer set one active goal ("Get 7 iron carry to 165 avg") and show progress toward it everywhere — on the Home page trends, on the My Bag page for that club, at the top of every Practice session with that club. Golf improvement is slow and invisible without tracking. The data is already there; you just need to surface "you were at 158 avg four weeks ago, you're at 162 now" as a first-class element, not buried in a chart the golfer has to build themselves.
